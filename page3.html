Leona joined Los Guadalupes, a secret rebel society receiving and distributing correspondence for the independence
of New Spain from the Spanish Crown. Leona expanded her involvement by using her banking connections to secretly finance 
various stages of the rebellion.She furthered her commitment by directly buying arms and acquiring materials to make cannons 
and artillery. Leona also arranged the purchase and shipment of medicines to Vera Cruz. 
She secretly transported them to neighborhoodsin Mexico City where she also hid revolutionary compatriots.
Not content as a rebel and arms dealer, Leona then teamed with Quintana Roo to perfect her journalistic prose and write political 
articles. He provided his family's printing presses to produce their liberal political ideas for the masses. Leona's revolutionary networks
then distributed those leaflets, informing the public of Spanish atrocities towards Native and Mestizo civilians, crimes associated 
with the established social caste system, and the need to obtain independence of Spain.
1813, Leonaâ€™s correspondence to Andres and her revolutionary network was intercepted by Spanish Royalists.
She was arrested fleeing Mexico City. Because of her social class status, the Court of Inquisition was limited 
in it's right to punish her brutally while interrogating her about the location of her revolutionary collaborators.
The court confiscated all her real properties and other bank assets, convinced a life without wealth and privilege would soon enough
reveal all the information they were seeking.
