Leona received a prodigious education, a rare privilege for women at the time. She enjoyed reading, and collecting English
and French literature. She also immersed herself in the fine arts, classical music, and singing. European literature at the time 
was filled with political idealogies/rhetoric of overthrowing oppressive monoarchies, while advocating for equality.
Leona's extensive education had given her a foundation to develop critical thinking skills, which encouraged 
independence from the pervasive patriarchy of New Spain (Mexico). Her attention soon turned to revolutionary idealists, at 
great personal risk. It also brought her to the attention of a succesful lawyer, Quintana Roo (also involved with idealists).
The pair were eventually married.
