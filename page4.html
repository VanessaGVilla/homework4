Leona was imprisoned for several months, when three colonial officers arrived unannounced. They demanded access to Leona,
 claiming the need for another interrogation. The officers revealed themselves as rebel patriots, assisting Leona escape
 by disguising her as a servent. She returned to Mexico City, reunited with her husband, where they both continued their revolutionary
 activities.Four years later, Leona and Andres were both arrested, but they were immediately granted amnesty from the Spanish
 Royalists. In 1823, the newly-formed Mexican Congress rewarded Leona Vicario for her numerous sacrifices on behalf of the nation
of Mexico.
Leona was given an estate, several houses in Mexico City, and a cash settlement for the total loss of her fortune in the service of
her country. Leona passed away in 1842. She received a Mexican State funeral, and her remains, which have been re-interred several
times, are at the National Palace placed in the National Gallery.
