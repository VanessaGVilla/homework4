Leona Vicario was born April 10, 1789 in Mexico City to well-to-do parents.
Her father was a merchant from Spain and her mother was from an equally wealthy 
family from San Salvador; several sources state both her parents were Spanish. 
She was raised in a wealthy, exclusive, highly educated lifestyleby her parents until 
she was 18, whereupon both died and lefther in the care of her paternal uncle, who 
practiced law, Agustin Fernandez de San Salvador Pompous. At 18 yers of age she had 
acquired an invaluable education, which she put to use by by filing for legal independence 
from her uncle, which allowed her to make all financial and legal decions in her own interest.
Leona had significant social standing in New Spain's (Mexico)racist caste system that 
was forcefully imposed on it by the Spanish. The 16th century Spaniards, along with their
overlords in the Roman Catholic Church, were so obsessed with race that they produced posters 
commissioned by artists to describe the 16 official racial mixture along with their legal statuses.
Because of Leona's heritage, she was publicly acknowledged at the top of society heirarchy.
It made her nearly untouchable when it came to capital crimes, along with a wealth of social privileges.
